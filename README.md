AncestryDotNom is a social media site for extended family groups. It mashes up simple genealogy with recipe sharing.

## Motivation<hr>
I grew up being part of a large extended family.  Our grandmother was a singular person who gathered us together several times a year for family meals. My aunts and uncles shared cassaroles, hot dishes, desserts, candies... the central theme was always food.
